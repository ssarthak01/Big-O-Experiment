# Big O Experiment
 Testing Runtime Efficiencies of Linked Lists v.s. Binary Search Trees v.s. Hash Table
 
 Two datasets each of 40,000 elements. Created and implemented classes of linked list, binary search tree, hash table with chaining, hash table with linear probing, and hash table with quadratic probing. Tested the average time for insertion and search of 100 items at a time from each dataset for each class.
